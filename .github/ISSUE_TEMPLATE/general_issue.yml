      FAQ
      Q1. I would like to translate a cheat sheet but do not see the original Keynote/Powerpoint/etc file.
      A1. All cheat sheets created by RStudio should include either a Keynote or PowerPoint file, usually both. 
      Some of the user submitted cheat sheets however may not. In that case [TODO]
      
      Cheat sheet development happens in bursts so your issue may sit for a while. Thank you for taking the time to ask questions/provide feedback/etc
