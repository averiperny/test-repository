Thank you for submitting a new cheat sheet!

Is the file name descriptive? Something like <package-name>.pdf or <task-name>.pdf

Do you have the following files:
  * .pdf
  * .png
  * .key or .pptx
  
Cheat sheets are usually added in bursts so don't worry if your pull request sits for a little bit!
