# How to Contribute a Cheat Sheet

## Contribute a New Cheat Sheet

Want to contribute a cheat sheet of your own?

Weâ€™d like to help you make and share high quality cheatsheets on R topics. The template below provides a useful starting place. It contains tips for designing a three or four column cheatsheet, as well as reusable elements to build your sheet with.

If you make a cheatsheet, we encourage you to share it here with us! We accept and post cheatsheets on a volunteer basis. Each cheatsheet must be licensed under the [creative commons 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) and be attributed to you, the author.

To submit a finished cheat sheet, open a pull request!

We ask you include:  
* A PDF file of your cheat sheet
* A .png image of the first page of your cheat sheet (for the website thumbnail)
* The original keynote or powerpoint file if possible (for translators)

Cheat sheet pull requests and issues tend be handled in bursts, and we may wait for several to accumulate before sorting through them so don't worry if your submission sits for a while!
